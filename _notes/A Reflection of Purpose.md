Thinking about concepts like ikigai and self authorship. What do I really want out of life? What drives me? Do I have a purpose? What do I think it means to have purpose?

These are hard questions. Drilling into the outline of what it means for us to be human.

I've always kind of railed against the concept of having a life purpose, but I think that is somewhat reliant on a stringent definition of what it means to have purpose. I don't think we need to be driven by some external meaning. Some grand goal and impact we have on the world.

I've never wanted to be big. Not famous. Not even classically 'successful.' I'm not driven by money or fame or mass validation. When I try to have public actions, it isn't about being seen but rather as a desire to connect.

We've been told that we need a grand purpose. We need to go out and change the world. Make great discoveries. Grow bigger than ourselves and leave our mark on the world.

Honestly, we already leave enough marks on the world. I'm not saying that I won't leave any marks of my own. That I won't leave any footprints. It is impossible not to. But I don't think I need to write a book. Become a CEO. Save lives. I'm not grand. I don't have big dreams.

But you know what? That's okay. Good even. I don't need to be another voice in the multitudes. I want to be small in my own way. I want to quietly make an impact in my immediate world. I want things to be better for the people I can directly impact. Instead of casting a wide net, I want to make concentrated but deep impacts.

My goals, my purpose, are internal. I want to live a happy life. I want peace. I want discovery. I want to constantly be learning, exploring, creating. I want to establish deep an meaningful connections with a small group of people I care about.

I want to bring light into the lives of the people around me. Tell a joke, make someone smile. Encourage and lift up the people I care about. Push people onto their own paths of self discovery and satisfaction.

I want to be a light, in my own life and those around me. I want to be there, and shine but not overwhelm.

A moon, not a sun.

A daisy, not a rose.

Valuable, but not Grand.

We don't need to be big. There are enough big people. There is value in the small. In the soft.
